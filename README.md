Based on initial work (C) 2012 Memphiz/Team Kodi (formerly Team XBMC)
Futaba LED display support for the FIC Spectra case (C) 2020 the-black-eagle

LCDproc support for Kodi implemented in Python, direct drop-in replacement for
the LCD support that was present in prior versions of XBMC and it's core.

This version adds support for the Futaba LED display found in the FIC Spectra
media centre case.  This is my own personal version of the add-on and is not
endorsed or in any way affiliated with Team Kodi.
